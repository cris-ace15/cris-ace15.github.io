        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Resident Evil 4 Remake is a modern reimagining of the iconic 2005
          survival horror game. Developed by Capcom, the remake retains the core
          storyline and characters while introducing updated graphics, enhanced
          gameplay mechanics, and a darker tone to match modern expectations.<br>
          The game was released on March 24, 2023. It launched on Playstation 4,
          Playstation 5, Xbox Series S/X, and PC. On December 20 of the same
          year, a mobile version on Apple's latest Iphone was released alongside
          a version for Mac. <br>The game scored incredibly positive reviews and
          sold over 20 million copies earning its rightful place alongside the
          legendary original Resident Evil 4 that launched in 2005.

          You play as Leon S. Kennedy, a government agent sent to rescue the
          U.S. Presidentâ€™s daughter, Ashley Graham, who has been kidnapped by a
          mysterious cult. Explore eerie villages, fight terrifying enemies, and
          survive against overwhelming odds in one of the most beloved entries
          in the Resident Evil franchise. Ammo is scarce, enemies are deadly,
          and every shot counts. Go through enemy territory guns blazing or opt
          for a stealthier approach to conserve ammo. Ashley is depending on you
          for survival. Will you complete the mission?
