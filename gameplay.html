        <h2>Combat Mechanics</h2>
        <p>The game features an over the shoulder view to keep you in the midst of the action. Engage enemies with a mix of firearms, melee attacks, and environmental interactions. 
          Utilize weapons ranging from
        long guns to handguns to explosive weapons. Use knives to fend off attackers or strike quickly and silently. All weapons are upgradeable
          upon visiting the Merchant; one of the few friendly faces in Resident Evil 4. He will also repair your knife for you once it breaks. Upgrades
          and repairs aren't free, but well worth it. You'll need to gear yourself up well. The island only gets more dangerous with time.
        <br><br>Do anything you must to survive.</p>

        <h2>Inventory Management</h2>
        <p>Use the iconic attach√© case to organize weapons, healing items, and ammo. The contents of your case is up to your discretion.
        Carry larger, more powerful guns at the cost of having less space for other items. Carry an abundance of ammo and health for the extra careful
        playstyle in exchange for less power, or try and find a balance. <br><br>The choice is yours.</p>

        <h2>Stealth & Strategy</h2>
        <p>Go guns blazing or take them out silently to conserve resources. Nothing is infinite. Go guns blazing and take out enemies quickly
        using your limited ammunition, or take it slower and use your knives to clear them out one by one. Use precious ammunition or your knife until it breaks. 
        There are a few different knives to pick up from specialized combat knives to basic kitchen knives, and they can all be used to take an enemy out in one blow or defend an attack. 
        Kitchen knives are more frequent but break extremely quickly. The combat knife is Leon's personal knife and you will always have it. It can break but can be repaired. Can you survive until you can fix it?
        <br><br>The only consistent thing is your wits.</p>
        

        <h2>Boss Battles</h2>
        <p>Resident Evil 4 Remake delivers unforgettable boss encounters that test your reflexes, strategy, and resource management. From towering monstrosities to relentless cult leaders, 
          each boss battle features unique mechanics and weak points. Players must adapt quickly, using every tool in their arsenal to survive. These intense encounters often mark key story 
          moments, blending horror and action in cinematic showdowns. Every boss has an effective way to defeat them, but the game doesn't give any hints. It's up to the player to figure it out and live
        to see another day. For example, the El Gigante boss is an immensely powerful towering giant who only knows destruction, he will attempt to squash the player under its feet or even grab buildings
        and throw them at Leon. On the back of its' head however, players will notice the parasite itself exposed. it can be difficult to line up a shot on a giants' head, but with consistent well placed shots,
        players will see how quickly that giant falls.
        <br><br>It's life or death, and they won't hold back.</p>
